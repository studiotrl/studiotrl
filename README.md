### Hi! 👋

**BioSketch**

I'm a South African computational conservation biologist with vast experience in modelling plant community structures, species distributions, composition and associated boundaries. I integrate modern statistical and geographical frameworks to identify trends in ecological data, assess and explore the effects of present-day and future environments on species distributions at large particularly for mainland sub-Saharan Africa.

**About Me**
- I am a jack of all trades and a master of one too many things 🪄
- I love generating maps to provide a bigger picture for conservation 🌐
- I enjoy coding, debugging and problem solving 👩‍💻
- I am proactive, goal driven, and can independently lead a project from start to completion ⏳

**UpSkills**
  
- Python
- Cloud computing
- SQL
- Science policy
- AI for conservation
